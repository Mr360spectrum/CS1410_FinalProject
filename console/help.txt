Kovarna is a game about combining items to get weapons and armor with better
and better stats.

Weapons and armor each have three different attributes. Weapons have a damage
modifier (Atk), critical damage chance (CritChance), and critical damage 
modifier (CritDmg). Armor pieces have a defense modifier (Def),
dodge chance (Dodge), and attack bonus (AtkBonus).

When you start a new game, you will be given a weapon to start with. After 
that, you will be able to go on to new areas. Some areas will have enemies,
chests, forges, or a combination of two or all of those things. 

Enemies will attack you first. You can choose to attack them, run, 
or open your inventory to select different weapons or armor to use.

Chests will contain either a weapon, piece of armor, or a stick. Weapons
and armor will have random stats assigned to them when added to the
inventory. Sticks can be combined in forges to create new weapons or armor
with slightly better stats than those found in chests.

Forges allow you to access new options in the inventory. One is to combine
two existing weapons or two pieces of armor to get something new. With this
option, you will choose which weapon or armor attribute to keep. This will
select the highest value for that attribute between the two items to be
applied to the new item. The average for each of the two other attributes 
will be applied to the resulting item.
